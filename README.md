# Painting-For-Kids
This project, developed for a Programming Techniques course, is a figure-drawing application that demonstrates mastery of C++ and object-oriented design. It allows users to create, transform (via moving, rotating, and scaling), and save geometric shapes, utilizing key concepts such as polymorphism, event handling, and file input/output operations.
